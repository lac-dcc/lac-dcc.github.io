<h1>Prospective Students</h1>

<p>
The Graduate Program in Computer Science (PPGCC) of the Federal University of
Minas Gerais
is one of the top graduate programs in Brazil, being ranked in the
highest level by the Brazilian Ministry of Education. PPGCC has
bestowed thus far more than 1,000 MSc degrees, and 150 PhD degrees. PPGCC's Alumni
work in the best universities and companies in the world. The solid
and broad academic education that the UFMG's graduate programs give to
students let them work in cutting-edge research institutions and in
the premier computer science industries.
</p>

<p>
The graduate program offers students excellent working conditions,
including research scholarships, high-tech laboratories, support for
participation in conferences and the opportunity to work with a highly
qualified faculty body.
UFMG has a beautiful campus, plenty of green areas and sophisticated
architecture. The campus is located in one of the most touristic
regions of Belo Horizonte. Its neighborhood enjoys easy access, has
several housing options, and offers students several facilities for
entertainment, such as shopping malls and sport centers. For more
information, see the <a href="http://www.ufmg.br/" target="blank">
university's website</a>.
</p>

<p>
The city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belo_Horizonte" target="blank">Belo
Horizonte</a> is located on the Brazilian highlands, a
region surrounded by green hills and amazing waterfalls. The city has
one of the highest human development indices in Brazil. In addition of
being a very pleasing place, Belo Horizonte hosts some of the best
museums in the country. Belo Horizonte is a strong candidate to become
Brazil's Silicon Valley. For instance, the city hosts research centers
such as Google's LatAm center, Cadence Design Systems' engineering
center, and Embraer's research lab. Besides, the city is home of San
Pedro's Valley, one of the largest breeding pools for Brazilian
startups.

<h3>Scholarships</h3>

<p>
The PPGCC offers scholarships sponsored by public agencies and private
companies to both PhD and MSc students. Applicants willing to receive
a Brazilian scholarship must indicate whether a scholarship is
mandatory (the applicant cannot enroll without a scholarship), not
needed (the student does not wish to receive a scholarship for he/she
already has other forms of funding) or desirable (the applicant may
receive a scholarship, however he/she will be able to enroll even if
he/she does not get the scholarship). Such indication happens in the
application form for MSc candidates, or in the work plan for PhD
applicants. Foreign students have access to other sources of fundings
as well. Students are advised to apply in advance, since evaluation
may take some time.
In addition to the state-sponsored scholarships, the Compilers Lab has
also a few scholarships sponsored by private companies.
If you want to apply to one of them, send an e-mail to
